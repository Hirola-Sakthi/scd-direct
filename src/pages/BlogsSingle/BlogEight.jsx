                vehicles must have the steering wheel on the right side of the
                car. For individuals importing cars from countries like the USA,
                Japan, or Europe, this presents a unique challenge. Most
                vehicles from these countries are left-hand drive (LHD), so they
                cannot be legally registered or driven on Australian roads
                without professional conversion.
              </p>
              <p>
                A proper RHD conversion ensures your imported vehicle is safe,
                legal, and fully functional for Australian conditions. Companies

              </ol>
              <p>
                Australia&rsquo;s vehicle regulations are strict. All vehicles
                used on public roads must comply with Australian Design Rules
                (ADR). Driving a left-hand drive vehicle without proper
                conversion can lead to fines, invalid insurance, and the
                inability to register your car. RHD conversion ensures your
                vehicle meets legal standards.

              </ol>
              <p>
                Driving an LHD vehicle on Australian roads can be dangerous. A

              <p>
                Insurance companies typically require vehicles to be RHD for
                full coverage. Moreover, converted vehicles that meet ADR
                standards have higher resale value and are easier to sell in
                Australia.

              <p>
                Before any work begins, a certified engineer inspects the
                vehicle to assess its suitability for conversion. This includes
                checking:

                The steering wheel, column, and associated linkages are
                relocated from the left to the right side. Advanced vehicles
                require precise adjustments to maintain alignment, stability,
                and safety.

              </ol>
              <p>
                Modern vehicles have complex electrical systems. Wiring for
                instruments, sensors, and electronic modules is rerouted to
                match the RHD configuration. This step is crucial for
                maintaining all safety and operational features.

                Wiper orientation is modified to ensure proper visibility. Side

                Once the conversion is complete, a certified engineer inspects
                the vehicle to ensure it meets ADR standards. Compliance
                documentation is issued, allowing the vehicle to be registered
                in Australia.

                RHD conversion costs vary depending on the vehicle make, model,
