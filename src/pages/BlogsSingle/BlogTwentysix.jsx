                vehicles, which are not legal for everyday driving in Australia.

              <p>
                Australia requires all vehicles on public roads to be right-hand
                drive. LHD trucks are only allowed under special permits, which
                are temporary and limited in scope. Professional RHD conversion

              </ol>
              <p>
                RHD trucks offer better visibility, safer overtaking, and proper
                positioning of controls. Driving an LHD truck on Australian
                roads can be unsafe, particularly when towing caravans or heavy
                trailers.

                RHD conversion increases the resale value of American trucks in
