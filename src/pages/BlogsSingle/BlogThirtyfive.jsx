                <Link to="https://www.chevrolet.com/">Chevrolet Silverado</Link> and
                GMC Sierra are highly sought after in Australia for their power,
                durability, and towing capabilities. These vehicles are ideal
                for both commercial use and recreational purposes, including
                towing caravans and trailers.

                However, most models come as left-hand drive (LHD), which is not
                legal for standard road use in Australia. This makes right-hand
                drive (RHD) conversions essential. At SCD Direct, we specialize

                <strong>Why RHD Conversion is Important</strong>
              </h2>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong> Legal Requirement</strong>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Driving an LHD vehicle on Australian roads without approval is
                illegal, except for rare exemptions. RHD conversion ensures the
                truck is road-legal and fully compliant with ADR standards.
              </p>
              <ol start="2">

                  <strong> Safety</strong>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Australia&rsquo;s road system is designed for right-hand drive
                traffic. Converting to RHD ensures better visibility, safer
                overtaking, and proper control orientation.
              </p>
              <ol start="3">
                <li>
                  <strong> Resale Value</strong>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                An ADR-compliant RHD truck retains higher resale value, as
                buyers can be confident it is safe and legal for everyday use.
