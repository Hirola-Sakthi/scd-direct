                <b>I</b>mporting American trucks into Australia is an exciting way to
                access powerful, versatile vehicles like Ford, RAM, and
                Chevrolet trucks. However, before they hit Australian roads, all
                vehicles must comply with ADR (Australian Design Rules). ADR
                compliance ensures your truck is safe, reliable, and legal for
                registration, especially after a Right-Hand Drive (RHD)
                conversion.

              <h2>
                <strong>What is ADR Compliance?</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                The Australian Design Rules (ADR) are a set of national
                standards that regulate vehicle safety, emissions, and
                roadworthiness. These rules apply to all vehicles imported into
                Australia, including American trucks. Compliance ensures:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Safety on Australian roads</li>
                <li>Proper functioning of all vehicle systems</li>
                <li>Legality for registration and driving</li>
                <li>Protection of drivers, passengers, and other road users</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Without ADR compliance, a vehicle cannot be registered in
                Australia, which makes it illegal for standard road use.
