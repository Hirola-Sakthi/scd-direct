                <strong>What is ADR Compliance?</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                Australian Design Rules (ADR) are a set of national safety
                standards that vehicles must meet to be legally driven on
                Australian roads. For American trucks, ADR compliance covers:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Braking Systems:</strong> Ensures trucks can stop
                  safely under load.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Lighting and Indicators:</strong> Headlights,
                  taillights, and turn signals meet Australian standards.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Suspension &amp; Steering:</strong> Trucks handle
                  Australian roads safely, including off-road conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Airbags and Crash Safety:</strong> Passenger
                  protection meets ADR regulations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Seatbelts and Safety Features:</strong> All vehicles
                  must have approved restraints and safety mechanisms.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Without ADR compliance, imported American trucks cannot be
                registered or legally driven in Australia.

                <strong>ADR Compliance and RHD Conversion</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Most American trucks are left-hand drive (LHD), so RHD
                conversion is required for Australian roads. ADR compliance and
                RHD conversion are closely linked:
