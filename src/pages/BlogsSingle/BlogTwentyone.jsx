                <strong>What is Vehicle Compliance in Australia?</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                Vehicle compliance in Australia refers to ensuring that imported
                or modified vehicles meet the country&rsquo;s safety,
                environmental, and legal standards. Key aspects include:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>RHD Conversion:</strong> Left-hand drive trucks must
                  be converted to{" "}
                  <Link to="https://scddirect.com.au/">right-hand drive</Link> for
                  legal use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>ADR Compliance:</strong> Trucks must meet Australian
                  Design Rules for brakes, lighting, suspension, airbags, and
                  safety features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Registration Standards:</strong> Only vehicles meeting
                  compliance standards can be registered with state transport
                  authorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Towing and Payload Compliance:</strong> Trucks must
                  safely handle caravans, trailers, and heavy loads according to
                  ADR regulations.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Without proper compliance, trucks cannot be legally driven and
                may incur fines or penalties.
