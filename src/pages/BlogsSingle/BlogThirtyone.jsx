                <strong>Why Import an American Truck?</strong>
              </h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Powerful Engines:</strong> American trucks offer V8
                  and turbo diesel engines suitable for heavy-duty work and
                  towing.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Towing Capability:</strong> Perfect for caravans,
                  trailers, boats, and commercial use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Durability:</strong> Built to handle long distances
                  and rough terrains.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>RHD Conversion Availability:</strong> Professional
                  services like SCD Direct handle right-hand drive conversions
                  and ADR compliance.

              </ul>

                <strong>Rules for Importing American Trucks</strong>
              </h3>

                  <strong> Right-Hand Drive Conversion (RHD)</strong>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Most American trucks are left-hand drive. To legally drive
                  them in Australia, an RHD conversion is mandatory.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The conversion must include steering, pedals, dashboard
                  instruments, and controls relocated to the right-hand side.

                  Trucks must meet Australian Design Rules (ADR) for braking,

                </li>
                <li>
                  ADR compliance ensures the truck is roadworthy, safe, and
