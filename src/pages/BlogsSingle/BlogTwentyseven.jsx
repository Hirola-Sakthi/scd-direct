                  </strong>
                  American trucks come with V8 and turbo-diesel engines capable
                  of producing massive torque, making them ideal for heavy
                  towing, construction work, and long-distance driving.

                  Built to endure rough terrains and heavy workloads, American
                  trucks are often more robust than domestic alternatives,
                  making them perfect for Australian conditions.

              </p>
              <p>
                Most American trucks are left-hand drive (LHD), which is not
                road-legal in Australia.{" "}
                <Link to="https://scddirect.com.au/">RHD conversion</Link> involves
                relocating the steering wheel, pedals, dashboard, and controls,
                ensuring safe and compliant driving.

                <strong>ADR Compliance</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                The Australian Design Rules (ADR) regulate vehicle safety,
                lighting, brakes, and emissions. SCD Direct ensures all imported
                trucks meet these standards after conversion.

                <strong>Shipping and Import</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Importing a truck involves international shipping, customs
                clearance, and import duty. Duties are usually 5% of the vehicle
                value, plus GST of 10%, which must be considered in the overall
                budget.
