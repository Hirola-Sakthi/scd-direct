              </h4>
              <p>The total cost includes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Base Truck Price:</strong> Varies depending on make,
                  model, and trim.

                  <strong>Shipping &amp; Insurance:</strong> $3,000&ndash;$7,000
                  AUD depending on origin port.

                  <strong>Import Duty &amp; GST:</strong> 5% import duty + 10%
                  GST on the truck value.

                <strong>Step 3: Right-Hand Drive (RHD) Conversion</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>
                Most American trucks are LHD, which is not road-legal in
                Australia.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  RHD conversion relocates steering, pedals, dashboard, and
                  controls.
                </li>
                <li>Ensures safe driving and full ADR compliance.</li>
                <li>
                  Conversion costs typically range from $15,000 to $30,000 AUD
                  depending on complexity.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Australian Design Rules (ADR) ensure trucks are road-legal and
                safe. Modifications may include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Braking systems and ABS upgrades</li>
